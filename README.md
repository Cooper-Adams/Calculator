# Calculator

Project Specifications: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator

Initial functions to be built for ease of use, then to be converted for GUI functionality later on.

The calculator will need to be able to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. The operate() function will take in two numbers and then call a function to get the desired operation.

Step 2 is to create the frontend, a calculator. It will be a stylized box containing an appropriate amount of buttons (likely 15 when finished).

The look for the calculator is finalized, and makes use of the color palette found here: https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1006144

Step 3 is to add functionality to the buttons. This will entail on-click event listeners and updating the display to match what has been clicked.

Step 4 is to follow the functionality with testing and ensure that the mathematical operations are being performed correctly according to project specifications (i.e. do the operations in order of what was pressed, rather than the typical order of operations).

Step 5 is to add functionality for keyboard presses, i.e. allow the user to operate the calculator exclusively with the numbers 1-9 and symbols '=', '-', '+', '*', and '/'. If any other errors are found within the logic while testing the button presses, they will also be addressed.
